          <h3>About The Project</h3>
          <p id="description">
            The aim of this project was to study UFO sightings from the year of 2016, and display our findings on a delightfully retro webpage! 
            We found this <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/ufo-sights-2016-us-and-canada">dataset</a> on Kaggle and it includes over 5,000 sightings. 
            We wanted to focus on the location of sightings, their descriptions, and other trends found in the data.
          </p><br>
            <p id="description">First we cleaned the data in Python using the Pandas library. The date strings were inconsistent in format and we wanted them to be in datetime format. 
              Using the tips we found from StackOverflow, we converted the dates.</p><br>

              <p id="description">Then, we imported the data into a Postgres SQL database. Using SQLAlchemy we accessed this database to create a Flaskapp.
              On this app we hosted an API containing our Jsonified data.</p><br>

              <p id="description">Using our API, we called the data into our Javascript file through the D3 library.
              We used Leaflet to display the sightings on an interactive map, and the Chart.js library to create a dashboard detailing popular trends in our data.</p><br>

              <p id="description">Finally, we created a webpage to display our results using css styling aiming to capture the retro-charm of websites from the 90s!</p>

          <p id= "description"> We are Amber Aeschbach, Layla Burgan and Clare Sakauye. This project was completed over the course of two weeks. We drew inspiration from the X Files and the Space Jam Official Website! 
            We are proud to bring you a website that looks like it could be a cool corner of the web in 1999, powered with 2023 technology.
